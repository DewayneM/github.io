Review Every Day

Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.

Cultivate quality time: With myself, with other people, and with my interests.
Look at what's uneasy: Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention.
Slog towards riding a bike on my 100th birthday: Eat mostly plants. Exercise regularly. Think decades, not days.

Lexicon

This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain.

Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.

Quality Time

My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. I see 3 kinds of quality time that we should seek out. The first is quality time with our own selves. Know thyself, and in the process find our deep interests and find people that we can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those interests, and the third is quality time with those people we can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other, you can't really connect deeply with others until you know yourself sufficiently well. And often times interests are strengthened by having people you can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with yourself, your interests, and others and you will not regret anything on your death bed (see The Death Bed Game for more thoughts around that).

Kiloslog

My 37th year started off on an exploration of the kiloslog, which is my made-up word representing the idea of working slowly towards a distant goal (see 1 Metric Kiloslog for a full explanation). I set the goal to do 1,000 small things that would get me closer to running a marathon. I've been thinking about this all year and ended up finally going on a couple 5+ mile runs in the last few weeks after spending almost an entire year working on knee issues. I actually felt quite victorious even with this small goal since the frustration of this particular knee issue has felt extremely frustrating in its lack of progress despite PT, stretching, and lots of patience. I'm still not entirely sure that I'll be able to fully recover without giving in to knee surgery, but since it's gotten a bit better recently I'm holding out hope. That said, I also have a referral for a good local orthopedic surgeon to take a look the second I lose hope. I did stop using technology to track my progress around 900/1000, because I found that the work of tracking was as difficult as the work itself. A common theme in my frustrations with quantified self and self-tracking in general.

In addition to working on the kiloslog towards running a marathon, I've also started fixating on an even longer-term health vision: to ride a bike on my 100th birthday. I like thinking about this for a couple reasons:

It's a silly visualization. I can actually sort of picture myself, aged 100, getting on a bike and wobbling down the street. Perhaps a crowd is cheering me on. Perhaps we live in a cloud city and we're all cyborgs. The daydream is ripe with material to play around with.
It gives my progress towards health a purpose. The intrinsic motivation that this taps into is part of my core quality of life motivation. I want to enjoy a long, healthy life, for the purposes of enjoying it all the way through to a simple activity on my 100th birthday.
It's flexible in the short-term but encourages long-term consistency. I don't have to sweat the small things that aren't going to make a long-term impact, simply because they are part of some program that's supposed to have a short term impact.
This single, silly, vivid health vision informs my eating habits, my exercise routine (for the kiloslog and other stuff), my stress levels, my creativity, and my social habits. It's a single ribbon that ties it all together, paces me, keeps and makes me happy to think about.

Optionality

Or, as Nassim Nicolas Taleb calls it: antifragility. I like the word optionality because it seems more neutral, almost boring even, and yet it is probably one of the most simple and powerful ideas that I’ve ever encountered. The easiest way to describe it is the degree to which your eggs are in different baskets. The more baskets, and the more eggs, and the more evenly distributed those eggs are in those baskets, the higher the optionality. The beauty of optionality is that it has both protective and self-strengthening qualities. Say that you have 12 eggs in 1 basket. If something happens to that basket, all of your eggs are doomed (low optionality). On the other hand, say that you have 12 eggs in 6 baskets (2 in each). If something happens to one of the baskets, you still have 10 eggs (higher optionality). Now imagine that you have 12 eggs in 12 baskets, and every time one of the baskets is destroyed, one of the other eggs hatches and creates 2 new eggs and you get 2 new baskets. Now, say that all of the eggs are different colors, and that there are monsters that prefer certain colors of eggs for breakfast. As the monsters wake up every morning and have breakfast, the type of eggs that they like will become more rare. There will be more eggs left from colors that they don’t like. In a way, the set of eggs will become stronger (less likely to be eaten). This is how high optionality works. The final twist is that in order for this to really work, it has to have some level of randomness involved… because what if the monster also adapts over time and begins to prefer new colors of eggs… in order for the set of eggs to be safe from complete elimination, there should be enough variation in the colors that some eggs won’t get eaten… and that those eggs will hatch and grow and the population of future eggs will represent eggs that are less appetizing to monster. Optionality is the key to natural selection and evolution. It’s also the key to idea generation, investment strategy, product management, and many other things. Qualities of high optionality things include:

A variety of options that aren’t connected to one another. For example, if you have 3 green eggs in 3 baskets and a green-egg eating monster comes, you’re going to lose all of your eggs even though they were in different baskets. Same if you own 3 different houses that are all on the same block and it gets hit by a flood, or 3 different emerging tech stocks when the equity markets dry up. True variety would imply that a disaster of any kind won’t take out all of your options… at least 1 must survive and it needs to be a strong one that has traits that led to its survival. Another word to describe this is that the options must be diversified.
There should be relatively quick feedback loops. The period of time between “something bad happens” and “the population shifts to favor the stronger options” should be short. If 10 bad things happen before the population adapts, the optionality is lower than if it only takes 1 or 2 bad things to adapt.
The adaptations must have some element of randomness. In other words, variety must not decrease over time, even if the environment becomes predictable. Eventually the environment will change in a new way, and then the variety will need to be sufficient to survive an unexpected change. If a green-egg eating monster turns into a red-egg eating monster, there should be some non-red eggs, and maybe even some green eggs, around.
This makes logical sense, but in practice it seems counter-intuitive to build systems with high optionality. We tend to build systems that converge on a single design over time (see monocultures) because they are predictable and efficient in a given environment. But environments change, and without the ability to predict how those changes will happen ahead of time, optionality is required even in the safest of environments.

I rambled on even longer about this topic here: Live like a hydra.

Soloverse

Soloverse: This is the least-fully-formed idea of the bunch and something that I’m sure will shift over time. The universe is this giant space/time environment that we are all a part of. The soloverse is our mental model of the universe that our brain uses to think about the universe and everything in it. It turns out, we can’t really think about the universe directly (it’s way too big), we can only think about our mental model of the universe as it exists in our soloverse.

I first came across this idea last year and found some interesting explorations of the idea referenced by the word umwelt, which is German for “environment” or “surroundings” and pronounced oom-velt. I just made up the term soloverse because it’s easier for me to think of it as a private universe in our minds.

A few thoughts about soloverses:

The soloverse is our local cache of the universe. When we’re babies, our caches are not very primed, and we are forced to take in the full firehose of the universe… unsorted, uncategorized, raw. It’s overwhelming. Our brains are designed to start building this soloverse almost immediately in order to gain some foothold on the raw craziness of all the information coming in. The soloverse is built up from basic building blocks like light and dark, smells, sounds, and eventually patterns (mom, hungry, cold, soft), and then eventually concepts (blanket, food) and meanings (safe, scared, good, bad).
What we think of as the universe is actually our soloverse. From these basic building blocks we create beliefs and build simulations that allow us to predict future occurrences (if I cry, mom will come to me). At some point we arrive at a concept of our own selves and other people. “The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.”?—?Kevin Smokler
The soloverse contains gods and archetypes. Some of our most powerful beliefs and traditional characters (God, the hero, the devil, the wizard, the fairy godmother) all exist only in our soloverses. Unicorns, dragons, Santa, astrology, luck, fairness, truth, good and evil, beginning middle and end, physics, etc are all shadows of the structure that our soloverse is running on (our brains, and the pattern matching hierarchies that they are built from) and most likely absent from the universe that they are attempting to model. This quirk is actually really fascinating to explore.
The soloverse is the most powerful tool we have. The model of the universe that we each have is highly personal, and idiosyncratic to the experiences we’ve had. There are also large portions of which there is probably lots of overlap (common sense, myths, popular culture, things we learn in school, etc). An unhealthy soloverse could lead to poor/misinformed decision-making. An unhealthy soloverse could be responsible for cruelty, prejudice, hatred, wars, and all kinds of other unfortunate things. What could we do to help ourselves and each other have healthier soloverses? Could we address this issue directly and have an impact?
A comprehensively complete soloverse must also model every other soloverse that exists. In order to build a real “to scale” model of the universe it has to also include every other soloverse out there, including itself. We can’t escape our personal soloverse, but we can make it a more hospitable place to live in the meantime.
Iterated prisoner's dilemma

I started a new side project in May of 2014 to explore the world of iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies. Basically, an attempt to solve, through games, a philosophical problem: what is the right strategy for being nice vs mean in an unpredictable and changing world? (background on iterated prisoner's dilemma)

This interests me for a number of reasons.

It's an unsolved problem in sociology and psychology: what is the optimal strategy for cooperation/selflessness? Is there one that works in all possible circumstances or is there a logic to how a given set of circumstances creates an optimal strategy?
It has been explored to some extent, but there is by no means a full exploration of the space. The space to explore is finite, but extremely complex. There is an opportunity for a sufficiently flexible system to make progress on this problem fairly easily.
I like the idea of using technology to solve a fundamental psychological riddle. It's fun.
For now I'm just dabbling my toes in the idea, but I hope to slowly make progress on it on hyoomans.com. So far it's probably still too amorphous to have much popular interest. The hook is still buried in technicalities. Hoping to change that in the next couple months.

Beliefs

On the purpose of life

We don't have a purpose given to us, but we are allowed to make one up
My meta-purpose is to enjoy quality time (with myself, with others, and with my interests)
The best strategy to increase quality time: weaken the circumstances that hinder quality time, and strengthen the circumstances that encourage quality time
He who dies having experienced the most quality time wins
On personal conduct

I must strive to know what I really believe
I must not dilly-dally
I must be my word
I must have good intentions
I must admit to being the maker of my own meaning
I must not feel sorry for myself
I must have a vision that I'm are striving for
I must rally others with my vision
I must tie creativity and experimentation with survival
I must be the change I want to see
I must stake my reputation on my better self
I must be comfortable with the consequences of being who I am
I must make my own advice and take it
I must manage my stress, health, and clarity
I must study my mistakes
I must retry things I don’t like every once in a while
I must go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts
I must cultivate quality time with myself, with others, and with my interests
I must face things that make me uncomfortable
On Morality

Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others
Gay marriage should be legal everywhere
Abortion should be legal everywhere
Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere
Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
The death penalty should be used in extreme and certain cases to protect the public
Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment
Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry
Owning a gun should require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years
You don't need to ask permission to take responsibility for something that you find important (but you may not get credit)
On Spirituality

Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life
Souls don't exist separate from the physical body
The Gods of organized religion don't exist
Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it)
Astrology is entertainment
Magic and miracles don't exist outside the explanations of science
There is no heaven/hell
On Science & The Universe

Chances are, we live in a simulation
Other dimensions and universes exist
Micro and macro evolution happens
Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again
Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light
The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe
We have no cosmic significance
Aliens exist
Non-carbon-based life forms exist
Space travel throughout the universe is probably entirely the domain of robots and cyborgs
Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not)
On Health

We can change our behavior and habits (it requires a lot of energy)
Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
Acupuncture works, somehow
Vaccinations are good for babies and society
On Technology

Computers will be building better computers than humans by 2050 (the Singularity)
Humans, computers, and Earth will evolve into a super organism by 2200 (if we're still around)
Humans that embrace change (and give up some of their humanity) will survive the Singularity
Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)
On The Self

Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats
On Privacy

Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected
People, organizations, and governments will exchange privacy for connection when/if they eventually trust each other
Future-thinking people, organizations, and governments will make great strides towards being more trustworthy in order to earn this privilege of connection by 2050
Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050
On Logic

Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else)
Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely
On Education

Something will replace universities as we currently know them by 2030
On Politics & The Economy

Most jobs lost between 2008-2012 aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)
In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live (see disability trends as proxy for this)
We'll have a President that admits to being atheist or agnostic by 2025
Power will be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top
On The Future Of Earth (2100)

Global warming is real and will continue to cause bigger and bigger problems
There will be 10 billion people
80% of people will live in cities and new mega-cities by 2100
The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
Genetically modified foods will become the norm
Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil
On Biases

We tend to favor the beautiful
We tend to see what we expect to see
We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)
On Love

Soulmates exist
Love at first sight happens
Meta

We have very little control over what we believe in
Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
Wagers

With Carinna. By 2028, the equivalent of a college education (both in breadth of knowledge and value to career) will be available to anyone with an internet connection.
With Rick Webb. By March 1st, 2016, descendants of Google Glass will be seen regularly in the wild (in the same way that Fitbits, NikeFuel bands, and retina MacBook Pros are in 2013).

Monthly Reports
2014: ++----+---

October 1st 2014:

Summary: Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): bought a house, moved in.

Weight: 179.0 (-0.4)

Outcome of previous goal: Miss. Did pushups on 0 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

New goal: Do pushups on 2 or more days (low bars ftw)

September 1st 2014:

Summary: Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): visited Seattle, went to a wedding.

Weight: didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

Outcome of previous goal: Miss. Did pushups on 1 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

New goal: Didn't make a goal for this month. Circumstances have disabled my goal-making momentum.

August 1st 2014:

Summary: Looked at open houses every Sunday, made an offer on a house, lost. Shipped something cool at work. Started a new side project: Valleyball. Went to yoga at work, once, and failed to go back again (even though I'd like to).

Weight: didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

Outcome of previous goal: Miss. Did pushups on 9 out of 31 days... definitely did not continue the trend from last month. Circumstances shifted: lots of guests this month, getting my morning routine out of whack, and we were distracted by making an offer on a house (and all the errands that entails). Also, lots of work stuff: shipping Tweet activity dash, starting a new project, performance reviews, etc. As circumstances shift back into the morning routine's favor, I'm hopping back on the pushup wagon this month.

New goal: Do pushups on 9 or more days.

Codex edits: Added Paul Buchheit's Startup School talk to my personal canon.

July 1st 2014:

Weight: 179.4 (+2.1 - hmmm.)
